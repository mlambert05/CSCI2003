# Ecological Roles

## My favorites

Ecology is the study of the biotic and abiotic factors in a given space interacting with eachother.
Organisms fill Ecological nieches through the process of evolution eventually forming one cohesive unit that we call Ecosystems.
<p>Every factor is beautiful and worth appriciating for the job they preform. We can learn so much about this earth
from simply observing. Although some parts, the pretty ones get observed far more than others. My favorites are the ones who dont get enough love. Those being,

<ol>
    <li>Scavangers</li>
    <li>Decomposers</li>
    <li>Parasites</li>


<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">A world without them
    <li>Land animals would have never evolved</li>
    <li>Decomposition would take much longer</li>
    <li>Huge loss in biodiversity</li>
    <li>Roadkill would lay wasted for weeks</li>
    <li>Loss in horizontal gene transfer</li>
